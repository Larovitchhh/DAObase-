# DAObase-
DAObase. To get the base footprint onchain for Base network and get extra 10 points on Builderscore in Talent Protocol
Overview
Welcome to the DAO BadgeX repository! This project is dedicated to exploring and supporting the DAO BadgeX system, a pioneering on-chain reputation framework developed by DAOBase. DAO BadgeX is a dynamic NFT that evolves based on your engagement with Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) in the Web3 ecosystem. It tracks governance activities such as voting power, proposals, votes, and delegations, providing a transparent and immutable representation of your DAO contributions.
This repository serves as a hub for developers, DAO enthusiasts, and Web3 users to interact with or build upon the DAO BadgeX system. Whether you're here to mint your badge, integrate it into your project, or contribute to its development, we've got you covered!
Features

Reputation Tracking: Measures participation across multiple dimensions, including voting power, proposals, and delegations.
Multi-Chain Support: Integrated with seven blockchains, covering over 160,000 DAOs and 6 million governance users.
Community Rewards: Earn DAOBase points and potential token airdrops by engaging with the ecosystem.
Minting Interface: Simple process to claim your badge at daobase.ai/mintdaobadge.
